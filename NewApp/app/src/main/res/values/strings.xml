  <string name="coffeeDescriptionEspresso">Espresso (/ɛˈsprɛsoʊ/ (About this soundlisten), Italian: [esˈprɛsso]) is a coffee-making method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under pressure (expressed) through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roasts. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).</string>

In Germany it is generally known as a "Café Crème" or just "Kaffee" and is generally the default type of black coffee served, unless there is a filter machine.
        \n\nAs a colorful term it generally means "espresso", while in technical discussions, referring to the long drink, it may more narrowly be referred to as Swiss caffè crema.</string>
