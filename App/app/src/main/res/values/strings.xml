    <string name="coffeeDescriptionEspresso">Espresso (/ɛˈsprɛsoʊ/ (About this soundlisten), Italian: [esˈprɛsso]) is a coffee-making method of Italian origin, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under pressure (expressed) through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso coffee can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans and roasts. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).</string>

    <string name="coffeeDescriptionLatteMacchiato">Latte macchiato (Italian pronunciation: [ˈlatte makˈkjaːto]) is a coffee beverage; the name means stained or marked milk.

    <string name="coffeeDescriptionCaffeLatte">Caffe latte (or simply latte) (/ˈlɑːteɪ/ or /ˈlæteɪ/) is a coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk. The word comes from the Italian caffè e latte [kafˌfɛ e ˈlatte], caffelatte [kaffeˈlatte] or caffellatte [kaffelˈlatte], which means \"coffee &amp; milk\". The word is also sometimes spelled latté or lattè in English with different kinds of accent marks, which can be a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced according to the rules of English orthography.</string>

    <string name="coffeeTypeMilkFroth">Milk Froth</string>
    <string name="coffeeDescriptionMilkFroth">A milk frother is a utensil used for frothing milk, to be added to coffee (cappucino, latte, etc.). Its working mechanism is based on milk aeration. A thick and heavy foam is created by agitating air into the liquid. The tiny bubbles, which are formed during this process, make the milk texture lighter and increase its volume. There are three major types of milk frothers – manual, handheld electric, and automatic. A cappucino machine may have a steam nozzle which can be used to froth the milk. Some devices are able to froth and warm the liquid simultaneously.</string>

    <string name="coffeeTypeWarmMilk">Warm Milk</string>
