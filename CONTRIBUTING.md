# Contributing to CoffeeBreaker

CoffeeBreakerTM would appreciate any help to improve the project! 
Contributions may include bug reports, bug fixes, new features, infrastructure enhancements, or 
documentation updates.

## How to contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you found a bug in CoffeeBreaker, you can [create an issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).
If you are able to build the library locally, please check, if the problem still exists in the
[master branch](https://github.com/kerusey/CoffeeBreaker) before filing the bug. 
If you can reproduce the problem, please provide enough information so that it can be reproduced by other developers.
This includes:
  * The Operating System
  * The used CoffeeBreaker and dependencies versions
  * An example image that shows the incorrect behavior, or a respective code snippet (preferably in the form of a failing unit test)
  * The stack trace in case of an unexpected exception
For better readability, you may use [markdown code formatting](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for any included code.

### Proposing Enhancements

If you need a specific feature that is not yet implemented, you can also create a respective issue. 
Of course - implementing it yourself is the best chance to get it done! 

### Contributing Code

The preferred workflow for contributing code is to 
[fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [repository](https://github.com/kerusey/CoffeeBreaker) on GitHub, clone it, 
develop on a feature branch, and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) when done.
There are a few things to consider for contributing code:
  * Please use the same coding style as in the rest of the code
  * Use tabs instead of spaces
  * Provide meaningful commit messages and/or PR comments
  * Be ready to adapt your changes after a code review 
  * When copying existing code from other sources or repositories, please keep licensing in mind
  
### Contributing Documentation

This projects is in need of documentation - any help to add documentation infrastructure, 
inline documentation, how-tos or sample code is appreciated!

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to CoffeeBreaker!
